NOTE: The submission Demo video to Blackboard is of lower quality than the one on GitHub. If you find that the one submitted is too blurry, the one on Github is always available to you.

NOTE 2: If you want to run the code on your input files, you will need to put them in a "input files" folder inside your source folder
