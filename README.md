# DSA-Final-Project

This is my final project for the module CSU22012: Algorithms and Data Structures II during the academic year 2021-2022. 
There are three options a user can appeal of:
1. They can find the shortest path from bus stop X to bus stop Y. (Dijkstra's algorithm is implemented here)
2. They can search for bus stop names (this is implemented using preorder traversal of a TST)
3. They can search what bus stops arrive at what times (This is just quick sort on an array containing bus stop times)
